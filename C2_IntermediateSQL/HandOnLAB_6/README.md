# Accessing Databases with SQL Magic

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`DB0201EN-Week3-1-3-SQLmagic_SQlite.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to access and work with SQLite databases directly from within Jupyter using the **SQL magic commands** provided by the `ipython-sql` extension.

After completing this notebook, you will be able to:

- Perform simplified database access using SQL magic  
- Connect to an SQLite database using `%sql`  
- Run SQL queries directly inside Jupyter cells  
- Retrieve and visualize query results
